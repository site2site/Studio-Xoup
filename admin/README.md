# Studio-Xoup
  
  Admin

  The input of admin includs all the sensers(camera, temperature, humidity, light) and photos belongs to different shapes. In the main page, administrator can combine different information from different senser and shapes, and post them through the output option on the right. Or save those information as a new collection for weekend or specific event through the save as option on the left. 

  In this way, the calander can be arranged in two ways:

  1. weekend notification (information of the past week ans coming week, more focus on the general condition of different studio X in the passed week)
  A greeting text + Date + event + information of temperature / humidity / light with a hatch reflecting the data + photo

  2. Event notification (Only focus on different events that take place in studio X)

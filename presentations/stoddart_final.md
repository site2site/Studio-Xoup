### (1) Architecture = Definition of Space
### (2) API = Platform for Communication
### &there4; Architectural API = Platform for Communicating Between Spaces

***

#### Historically, architecture has defined the notion of place — fixing culture, people, and history to discrete locations on the planet. However, we are in transition, exchanging the stability and clarity of boundaries for an increase in connectivity. 

#### The Architectural API facilitates this exchange, a common language for augmenting the physical objects that already populate our environments to both collect and recieve data and to serve as conduits between physically separated spaces.


## On our way to here...

## Architectural Communication Technology

The major advances in communicative architectural devices - the door, the window, and the sign.

This is still the reality of how our spaces allow us to communicate with each other.

##Non-Architectural Communication Technology

Telephone (sound) --> Television (image) --> Internet (information)

![Mobile Hub](http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Apple-advert-FaceTime-Meet-Her.png)

All communication technologies collapsed into mobile hubs that we carry with us.

### Transmitted communication is always limited to a terminal

### Role of API is to standardize the message transmission so that any object can become a terminal

#### This works with existing objects...

#### ...or new connected (proprietary) products...

#### ...or with custom objects built from inexpensive components...

##Back to Studio-X...


#### This is the diagram for Studio-X, a series of nodes linked together...

#### ...but what are those links? Do they even exist?

### What is Studio-Xoup?

#### Xoup is a common platform for curating, publishing and sharing content. Studio-X produces content, but lacks a coherent medium for exchanging ideas both internally and externally.

#### Xoup builds off available, inexpensive technology stacks—a combination of low-cost micro-computers, micro-controllers, and a customizable array of sensors—capable of collecting and processing information from the Studio-X spaces.
![Xoup Object](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/images/Device/S2S_device_Elevation.png)

#### Using a simple method of applying physical tags, Xoup collects, crops, tags, and processes the content for sharing. Different tags produce different results, from sharing publicly, to sharing amongst all Studio-X locations, to sharing between two Studio-X locations.

#### Xoup also encourages external participation and documentation of the people who populate Studio-X, while automatically processing images to maintain the Studio-X brand.

#### This content manifests itself in two forms:

#### (1)
####A stream of data, rendered physical, in each Studio-X locations allows all members to be aware of happenings at other locations. Ideas can be borrowed, exchanged, critiqued and members can decide to contribute to another's line of inquiry.

####(2)
####Xoup shares this content online, using existing social media platforms, compiling the production, the happenings, and the people of all Studio-X into one accessible location.

![Xoup Tumblr](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/tumblr_theme/screenshots/xoup_01.png)

Content is shared chronologically, and tagged with information regarding the location, event, and ephemeral data.

![Xoup Tumblr Sort](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/tumblr_theme/screenshots/xoup_02.png)

Content can be filtered and sorted by this tagged information, to focus the stream to one location's output.
